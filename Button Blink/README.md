# Button Blink
The Button Blink involved a little bit more detail than simply setting the inputs and outputs and delaying the cycles. In the button blink code, resister enable (P1REN) is used so that the button can determine the state of the resistor (high, low). When P1OUT is ORed with Bit 3, that resistor is set to a pull-up resistor, connected to a set voltage. Once again, an infinite while loop was used. In it is an if statement that defines when the LED is on or off by virtue of whether the button is pressed or not pressed. The output was once again XORed to allow the Led to turn on and off if the button is held down.
